## Project Name

The aim of this learning exercise is to become more familiar with GitHub. And obviously with creating a website. 

This project was inspired by a website a friend made. And started after I viewed a website another friend made.

Link to the website: https://flying20.github.io/

* `The Starspawn is ready to guide you!` on the website acts as a `Hello, World!` message. :sweat_smile:
